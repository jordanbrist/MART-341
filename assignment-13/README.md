1. For my imaginary client, I used a fake restaurant that I had to make in a business class a couple of years ago. Their site needed to be filled with useful information about the business and their offerings as well as images showing the food. They wanted a simple color scheme that matched their logo.
2. Billions of people only access the internet through their smartphones and that number is growing by the year. It's better to have a site that is easily accessable by all than only some.
3. It was challenging getting items to scale properly, I think that mobile-first design is something that I need to put more thought into from now on.
