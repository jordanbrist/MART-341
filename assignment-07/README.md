# Assignment 7
## Jordan Brist

1. Most forms that come to mind when I think about my web browsing are surveys, applications, shipping/payment information and business contact forms.
2. Text inputs are text boxes commonly used for inputing names(plain text), emails(plain text), and other specific information that can't be selected from a list. They can have varying types that alter sizes for comment sections(text area) or censor sensitive information like passwords(password). Selection input is used for choosing information that must be one of a selection of certain items. They can be radio buttons that only allow one selection or checkboxes that allow multiple selections. Commonly used for multiple choice quizzes or surveys. Button inputs are used to submit information. With a button, one can interact with a webpage by clicking a single icon or link. They can be used for links to external sites or content, uploading content, submitting information, and more.

3. The most challenging part of this assignment was working with the different input types. They can be a little confusing at first but I eventually got the hang of it after re-reading the information on the course website and correcting some mistakes.
