1. Borders define the amount of space an element takes up. Padding is the amount of space between the content of an element and boundaries or border of an element. The margin is the space between an element and other elements.
2. The most challenging thing this week was getting the navigation menu to sit in the same general position as the rest of the content. I wanted it to be the same width, but I wanted it to have a small margin between it and the other elements. However, if I had any margin on the top or bottom, then it would shoot over to the left side. I tried adding extra space to the left margin, but if the window was resized then it wouldn't look very good. So, I couldn't get the menu to sit in the position I wanted without setting the margin to 0.
