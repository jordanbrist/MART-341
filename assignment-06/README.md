1. An HTML document can only have one head element and one body element. The head element contains information about the document such as author, title, date, and style information. the body element contains the data that is rendered and displayed.
2. Structural markup is used to change the layout or *structure* of the page. Semantic markup is used to convey meaning by showing the reader which parts of the text have more impact through the use of *italics*, **bold**, and more. 
3. This week wasn't super challenging, but I had trouble trying to figure out where to put some semantic markup in my document. I also had some trouble changing the font for my page, but it turns out that I'd just missed a semi-colon.
