1. Most of what we've done in HTML has been stuff that I have worked with before, but I don't think I've done much with div or other containers. It is cool to learn new things and easier ways to do things in HTML.
2. I'm excited to work with CSS. I like HTML, but I don't think HTML pages look very good without CSS. It will be fun to add more customization and flair.
3. The most challenging thing that I encountered was just trying to put the instructions into words without them becoming bogged down with too much content. I tried to make them as concise as possible.
