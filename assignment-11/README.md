1. System fonts are fonts that are already installed on your local device/system but may not be optimal for web due to licensing or because different operating systems using different system fonts. Web fonts are custom fonts hosted on a server that don't need to be installed on a local machine to work. Web-Safe fonts are fonts that are available across different operating systems and should always work properly due to reduced load times due to the font being pre-installed.
2. If the chosen font fails to load properly, then the fallback font will load in its place. A font stack is a list of fonts that the browser will try to load, in order, if the previous font fails to load.
