1. The id attribute specifies a unique identifier for a single element. The class attribute specifies one or more class names in order to group multiple elements. The div element is a block container used to divide a document and group elements. The span element is an inline container that is used to group and apply styles to elements and can be used inside of a div element.
2. Hosting videos through sites like YouTube and Vimeo can cut down on file size of the webpage, reduce loading times and bandwidth usage, and allow the video to retain compatability with other browsers and devices. Hosted content can also be more secure and less easy to download. However, payed services can be expensive and if the host is down or the video is removed due to licensing issues or a TOS violation then the content will no longer be viewable. 
3. The biggest challenge I encountered this week was embedding the YouTube video. I kept getting a "Video Unavailable" message and couldn't figure out what to do. It turns out there was nothing wrong and YouTube videos (or maybe just certain ones) only work on hosted websites. Everything worked once I published the file to GitHub.
